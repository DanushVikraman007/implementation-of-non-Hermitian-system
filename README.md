Objective 
The primary goal of this report is to simulate non-Hermitian quantum 
dynamics using Qiskit. This involves: 
1. Defining an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. 
2. Analysing eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian across a range of parameters. 
3. Designing a quantum circuit to imitate the system's dynamics and 
obtaining measurement outcomes via simulation. 
4. Determine the exceptional points and plot the results. 
 
 
 
Code Overview 
The code is divided into three main sections: 
1. Defining and Analysing the Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian 
2. Visualizing Eigenvalue Behaviour 
3. Plotting exceptional points 
4. Quantum Circuit Simulation
